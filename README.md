The following is website for the Assignment Round of elitmus hiring process. It is a treasure hunt game designed to test the soft skills of the player.
The game revolves around the famous fiction book and moviee series of 'Harry Potter'. A player in order to complete the game has to solve multiple problems at different stages. 
The problems are simple and fun with clues provided to solve them. There can be multiple answers to the problem, therefore leading to many different paths. The game is designed as such that there is only one correct path and the rest other lead to dead ends.
The scoring system is based on negative scoring. Once a player starts the game he/she is provided with a fixed score. In case the player reaaches the dead end, to retrace the path, score would be deducted. Hence, a player in order to maintain good score, has to encounter least dead ends.
The game checks soft skills like visualisation, audio hearing, genral knowledge and problem solving.
