                            <li>-> You recieved a note from anonymous person, which said that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is in danger. Some dark magic has been cast on the castle and it is not safe anymore to operate the school.</li>
                            <li>-> The castle and the proximities have now been abandoned. Everyone is now exile.</li>
                            <li>-> However the note which you recieved said, "There Is A Hidden Note In The Castle", which you have to find through subsequent clues and notes which are also hidden in the castle.</li>
                            <li>-> Get the final note as soon as possible to the Headmaster of The Hogwarts as that note contains the counter to the dark magic.</li>
                            <li>-> To find the note you have to solve the problems at different stages</li>
                            <li>-> There are clues given to solve the problem. Remember, there can be multiple correct answers to the question. Only one of them leads to the correct path to the final note</li>
                            <li>-> You are already provided with 200 Galleons, which is your score. In case you reach a Dead End, you'll have to pay price mentioned there.</li>
                            <li>-> The less you spend, the better you score.</li>
                            <li>-> You can always view hints to the problem because remember- "Help Will Be Always Given At Hogwarts To Those Who Need It"</li>
                            <li>-> Best of Luck</li>
